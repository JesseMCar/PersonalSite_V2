    <h1>About Me</h1> 
            <p>
            Hey I'm Jesse, I'm 19 years old and grew up in Port Coquitlam. 
            I graduated in June 2020 from Riverside Secondary. 
            I was on my schools tech team which gave me a tiny bit of IT support experience.
            I took a year off to work and during this time I studied for and passed Core 1 of the CompTIA A+ exam. 
            I took this program because I couldn't find an industry job with my level of experience 
            and wanted more hands on IT experience. 
            On my free time I like to play guitar, learn piano, play video games and see friends.
        </p>
